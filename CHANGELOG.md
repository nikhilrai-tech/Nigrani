# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Azure Monitor** (`azure:` config, read-only): an `azure` data source for alert rules (`Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
  "Percentage CPU" aggregation=Maximum`), one alert per resource of a type, an `azure` preset (VM, PostgreSQL, SQL,
  App Service plan), and the metric charted on the incident page. Entra ID service principal sign-in; sovereign clouds
  supported.
- **Datadog** (`datadog:` config, read-only): a `datadog` data source for alert rules (a Datadog metric query, one alert per
  series), a Datadog page listing monitors that are Alert, Warn or No Data, a `datadog` preset (host CPU, memory, disk), and
  the metric charted on the incident page. Any Datadog site.
- **Kubernetes** (`kubernetes:` config, read-only): a Kubernetes page (nodes, pods, deployments missing replicas, restarts),
  a `kubernetes` data source for alert rules (`crashloop`, `restarts_1h`, `not_ready_minutes`, `pod_failed`,
  `node_not_ready`, `deployment_unavailable`, narrowed with `namespace=` / `pod=`), a `kubernetes` preset, an RBAC
  example, and automatic in-cluster credentials.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added
- Several users with **roles** (viewer, editor, admin): a Users page for admins, scrypt-hashed passwords, role changes
  and disabling that apply to open sessions within seconds, and an **audit log** of sign-ins and changes.
  Every state-changing route needs at least `editor`; forgotten routes fail closed.
- **Single sign-on** with any OpenID Connect provider (Google, Microsoft, Okta, Keycloak, Dex...), authorization code
  flow with PKCE, verified e-mail only, restricted by `allowed_domains` / `allowed_emails`, roles from
  `admin_emails` / `editor_emails`. The configured administrator always works.
- **Sentry** (`sentry:` config): a Sentry page (search, sort, unresolved / new / fatal tiles), a `sentry` data source for
  alert rules where the value is the number of matching issues per project, a `sentry` preset, and the matching issues
  on an incident's page. Works with sentry.io and self-hosted Sentry.
- **AWS CloudWatch** (`cloudwatch:` config): a `cloudwatch` data source for alert rules (`AWS/RDS CPUUtilization{DBInstanceIdentifier="*"} stat=Maximum period=300`),
  one alert per resource, a `cloudwatch` preset (RDS CPU and storage, EC2 CPU and status check), and the metric charted on
  the incident page. Credentials from the config, the environment or the EC2 instance role; no AWS SDK needed.
- Grafana links (`grafana:` config): "Open in Grafana" opens Explore with an alert's query and time range, and your own
  dashboards are linked from the incident, container, host and overview screens, with `{container}`, `{from}`, `{to}`
  and other placeholders.
- Incident page (`GET /api/incidents/{id}`, `#/incident/<id>`): lifecycle timeline, the rule's metric with thresholds,
  the container's CPU/memory and logs around the incident, deploys, restarts and related alerts, plus a "What changed?"
  summary. Every notification, escalation, acknowledgement, silence and resolution is now recorded per incident.
- `/api/logs` accepts an explicit `start` / `end` window.
- Acknowledge an alert (`POST /api/incidents/{id}/ack`): pauses its reminders for a chosen time or until it resolves, tells
  the channels who is on it, ends when the alert gets worse, and is credited in the resolved message. New
  `{acknowledged_by}` and `{note}` template placeholders.
- Backup and restore of rules, channels and silences (`GET /api/backup`, `POST /api/backup/import`, **Backup** page):
  credentials are omitted by default, import starts with a dry run, is all-or-nothing and never deletes.
- Custom message templates per notification channel (`title_template` / `body_template` with placeholders such as
  `{rule}`, `{series}`, `{value}`, `{server}`, `{duration}`), validated on save, with a live preview in the channel editor.
- Logs page: "Create alert from this search" turns the current container / level / text filter into a log-based alert
  rule, with the rule editor prefilled and a live preview.

### Fixed
- **Crash loops were not detected.** The *Container restarting* rule and the Containers page's "restarts" column counted
  changes of cAdvisor's start time, which Docker's in-place restarts never change. They now count the RestartCount
  incarnations cAdvisor reports, so a container stuck restarting is reported.
- Fixes to a preset rule now reach existing installs. Rules you have not edited are updated on startup; edited ones are
  left alone.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-01

First public release.

### Added
- Dashboard: overview with threshold-aware tiles, containers, host (with disk-full forecast), logs (Loki),
  uptime checks (HTTP/TCP/TLS expiry), deploy markers from GitHub Actions, optional public status page.
- Presets for `core` (node-exporter + cAdvisor), `django`, `redis`, `postgres`, `rds`, `mqtt` and `celery`;
  custom pages and rules in YAML.
- Alert engine: pending/firing/resolved with de-duplication, reminders, escalation, silences, quiet hours,
  retry on delivery failure; rules editable in the UI with live preview.
- Notification channels: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Telegram, email, WhatsApp (Twilio), signed webhook.
- Incident history with a visual timeline, and a daily/weekly digest.
- Multiple servers (for example production and staging) in one dashboard, with an all-servers view and
  per-server rule/channel/silence scoping.
- Login, rate-limited, signed cookie sessions, CSRF protection and security headers.
- Log-based alert rules: `datasource: loki` evaluates a LogQL metric query against a server's Loki. New `logs` preset
  with an "Error spike in logs" rule; the rule editor can choose the data source and preview LogQL.
- `dev/lab`: real exporters used to verify the presets (django, redis, postgres, mqtt, celery).
- GitHub deploy markers ignore pull-request and Dependabot runs.
- Release automation: a `vX.Y.Z` tag builds and publishes a multi-arch image to `ghcr.io/nikhilrai-tech/nigrani`.

### Fixed
- A "resolved" message sent after a restart keeps the rule name and series, and a series that no longer exists
  no longer shows its last firing value as "Now".
